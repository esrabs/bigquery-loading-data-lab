# bigquery-loading-data-lab
A hands-on BigQuery project where I created a dataset, loaded NYC Taxi trip data from CSV files and Google Cloud Storage, executed SQL queries, and used DDL to create new tables. This project demonstrates data ingestion, transformation, and analysis using Google BigQuery.
